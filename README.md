Take a decision according to the Ticket issue, in this case it's an Urgent matter because Customers can't access the Website.Go to the "Priority" and set a Status as an Emergency with a short note something like : Emergency Event and update it.
</p>
<br />

<p>
Set SLA:service level agreement (SLA) to a ticket to specify the service commitments that must be met either by the service provider or the customer.
Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7)
Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7)
Sev-C (8 hours, business hours)
Select a SLA according to the Ticket deadlines.

<p>
Jack can see all Histroy, like:Customer name -> who assign a Ticket to him -> and request message from another agent to resolve this Ticket and now he start working on this Ticket.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
once he Resolved the Ticket/Issure he directly contact with Customer and send them email or phone call to give a update.And change the Ticket status to "Resolved" and Click Post reply.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
As you see, Ticket is removed from platform and there is no more Tickets,But if he has a more Tickets to resolve then he start working on it gradually and resolve it prior to SLA. I hope you understand and get an Idea that how Ticketing system works. Thank you!
